# ParkinsonDetection_LogisticRegression
This is same problem which is solved in https://github.com/ashishyadav24092000/Detect_Parkinson_XGBOOSTCLASSIFIER project.

But here we have used Logistic Regression instead of XGBClassifier to classify the Statuses as 0 or 1 i.e. Parkinson positive or negative. 

## And clearly we can see that how our Accuracy suddenly dropped from 95% to 84% as we moved from XGBClassifier to Logistic Regression.


## This implies that choosing algorithm for your model is significantly crucial part before making any important insight or predictions.
